# Copoint Service Schedule

## 1. Subscription Terms
Copoint is provided on a subscription basis ("Subscription"). You agree to pay the fees applicable to your chosen plan (e.g., Starter, Growth, Enterprise).
*   **Billing Cycle:** Fees are billed in advance on a monthly or annual basis.
*   **Auto-Renewal:** Subscriptions automatically renew unless cancelled at least 30 days prior to the end of the current term.

## 2. Service Level Agreement (SLA)
We guarantee that the Copoint platform will be available **99.9%** of the time during any monthly billing cycle (excluding scheduled maintenance).
*   **Remedy:** If we fail to meet this uptime guarantee, you will be eligible for a service credit of 5% of your monthly fee for every 1% of downtime, up to a maximum of 50% of your monthly fee.

> **Summary:** We promise 99.9% uptime. If we break that promise, we pay you back in credits.

## 3. User Seats and Licensing
Copoint licenses are sold on a "per-seat" basis.
*   **Named Users:** Each seat is intended for a specific, named individual. Seat sharing (multiple people using one login) is prohibited.
*   **Transferability:** You may transfer a seat from one user to another if the original user leaves the organization or changes roles.

## 4. Beta Features
From time to time, we may invite you to try "Beta" features at no charge. You designate that these features are for evaluation purposes only and are not subject to the SLA or WARRANTY.

## 5. Fair Use Policy
Copoint APIs are subject to rate limits to ensure stability for all customers. If your usage exceeds the limits defined in your plan, we reserve the right to throttle your access or request an upgrade to a higher tier plan.
